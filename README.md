## About this project

This project is inspired by [shahsagarm](https://github.com/shahsagarm/sagarshah.dev). I started by using the design from his [figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1262992249991763120) made some custom modifications, and then brought it to life through code.

All the code in this repository is made it by myself.
